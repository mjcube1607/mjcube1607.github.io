        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>I came to the United States from India to follow my passion for cybersecurity, graduating in May 2024 with a Master's degree in the field. The past two years have been a journey of challenges, learning, and growth. 
        Throughout my coursework, I tackled numerous projects that helped shape my skills, and I created this website to showcase those projects, as I believe a resume alone doesn't do them justice. 
        Beyond academics, I spent my spare time engaging in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, primarily on TryHackMe.</p>
